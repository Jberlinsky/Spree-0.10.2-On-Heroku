# Represents a preferred value for a particular preference on a model.
# 
# == Targeted preferences
# 
# In addition to simple named preferences, preferences can also be targeted for
# a particular record.  For example, a User may have a preferred color for a
# particular Car.  In this case, the +owner+ is the User, the +preference+ is
# the color, and the +target+ is the Car.  This allows preferences to have a sort
# of context around them.
