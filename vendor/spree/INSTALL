== Installation and Setup

1. Create the MySQL/PostgreSQL/SQLite databases for your Web site. You only
   need to create the "production" database, but you may also want to create
   the "development" and "test" databases if you are developing extensions
   or running tests.

2. Edit config/database.yml to taste.

3. Run the database migrations, seed data and set up the admin user:
   
     $ rake db:bootstrap RAILS_ENV=production 
   
   (NOTE: In dev mode you can just run `rake db:bootstrap`.)

4. Start it like a normal Rails application. To test execute:
   
     $ script/server -e production
   
   And open your Web browser on port 3000 (http://localhost:3000). The
   administrative interface is available at /admin/. By default the bootstrap
   rake task creates a user called "spree@example.com" with a password of "spree".
