Description:
    The extension_model generator creates stubs for a new model for an 
    extension.

    The generator takes the extension name and a model name as its arguments. 
    The model name may be given in CamelCase or under_score and should not be 
    suffixed with 'Model'.

    As additional parameters, the generator will take attribute pairs 
    described by name and type. These attributes will be used to prepopulate 
    the migration to create the table for the model and give you a set of 
    predefined fixtures. You don't have to think up all attributes up front, 
    but it's a good idea of adding just the baseline of what's needed to start 
    really working with the resource.

    The generator creates a model class in 
    vendor/extensions/extension_name/app/models, a test suite in 
    vendor/extensions/extension_name/test/unit, test fixtures in
    vendor/extensions/extension_name/test/fixtures/singular_name.yml, and a 
    migration in vendor/extensions/extension_name/db/migrate.

Examples:
    ./script/generate extension_model MyExt account

        This will create an Account model:
        
        Model:      vendor/extensions/my_ext/app/models/account.rb
        Migration:  vendor/extensions/my_ext/db/migrate/XXX_add_accounts.rb
        Spec:       vendor/extensions/my_ext/spec/models/account_spec.rb
        Test:       vendor/extensions/my_ext/test/unit/account_test.rb (if extension created with "--with-test-unit")
        Fixtures:   vendor/extensions/my_ext/test/fixtures/accounts.yml (if extension created with "--with-test-unit")

    ./script/generate extension_model MyExt post title:string body:text

        Creates post model with predefined attributes.
